    <blockquote>*'My work is a language, and that language says what it has to say.' *   <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-1" href="#note-1">1</a>]</small></blockquote>
    <p>How can one obtain a clear view of the work of Myriam Mihindou?  <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-2" href="#note-2">2</a>]</small></p>
    <p>This artistic oeuvre can be read as a collection of 'searching works of art'.  <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-3" href="#note-3">3</a>]</small> To reveal which questions it raises and to articulate its layers of meaning, two types of source are drawn on in this analysis: the work itself,  <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-4" href="#note-4">4</a>]</small> and its context, i.e. statements by the artist and the reception of her work.  <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-5" href="#note-5">5</a>]</small></p>
    <h4>Daphne Pappers</h4>
    <p>To begin with the latter: awareness of shared mental patterns makes it possible to <em>unmask clich&#xE9;s</em>. Those (unconscious) frameworks can be identified in the <em>conventional reception</em> of the work of artists whose work is usually labelled as different. The artist's <em>biography</em> is often the starting point in which striking local <em>cultural characteristics</em> assume a dominant voice to explain pictorial motifs. In the long run a contextual reading of this kind is insufficient and unsatisfying. <em>Particularism</em>  <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-6" href="#note-6">6</a>]</small> starts to pinch when you bring in the work itself and statements by the author. In the case of Mihindou, who deploys the human <em>body</em> as visual material, <em>Simon Njami</em> has aptly put it like this: &#x2018;[The body] becomes the materialisation of an idea, an instrument of communication and mediation through which the artist speaks to the Other, that Other who looks cannot help <em>qualifying</em>. For the body is the first concrete element through which we are perceived.'  <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-7" href="#note-7">7</a>]</small> The artist herself states that <em>alterity</em> does not exist for her, although her work provokes that connotation (and the concomitant assumptions) in many viewers. She told <em>Rosi Braidotti</em> that she experiences herself as the other, <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-8" href="#note-8">8</a>]</small> in line with the ideas of <em>Homi Bhabha</em> and <em>Julia Kristeva</em>. <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-9" href="#note-9">9</a>]</small> Mihindou's performative languages can thus be read as reactions to confrontations due to alterity as experienced by others.</p>
    <p>In order to shake off a historically formed perspective informed by religious and political relations of <em>power</em>, the viewer can decide to start out from actual <em>perceptions</em> instead of the artist's biography. <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-10" href="#note-10">10</a>]</small> The diversity of motifs and materials in Mihindou's work encourages the viewer to work like an <em>archaeologist</em> who excavates one work after another and lays out the found fragments one by one in order to obtain a total picture. <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-11" href="#note-11">11</a>]</small> Each fragment is supplied with a <em>label</em> recording the finding place (work, medium, year) and placed in order. The result is a <em>reconstruction</em>. This intervention is a way of <em>mapping</em> the intuitive and stratified oeuvre before getting down to the business of interpretation.</p>
    <p>Another instrument for opening up the reception of Mihindou's work to new interpretations is the essay by Liesbeth Levy in this publication. Drawing on <em>Emmanuel Levinas</em>, <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-12" href="#note-12">12</a>]</small> she makes a committed appeal to the <em>encounter</em> with the other: 'So apparently there is a sense to be found in those other cultures without first having to be able to understand that language and that culture. That sense, which confers meaning irrespective of the cultural horizon, language and ethnic roots, is the <em>face</em> of the other person.' <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-13" href="#note-13">13</a>]</small> From her position extraneous to art criticism, Levy finds words for the major obstacle to the reception of the work of Mihindou: alterity.[^] Alterity is discussed (along with identity and hybridity) by Joep Leerssen with multidisciplinary references in <em>Imagology. The cultural construction and literary representation of national characters. A critical survey</em>. Beller, Manfred and Joep Leerssen (eds), Editions Rodopi, Amsterdam/New York, 2007, Studia Imagologica XIII, 335-342. This text is included in full in Part III of the CWW series.
] She hereby offers the viewer a new point of entry into that work. Without passing a value judgement on either the work or the viewer, Levy throws light on the <em>intercontinental potential</em> of the oeuvre so that the argument of the 'searching objects' becomes visible.</p>
    </div>
    <p>**Components of <em>equal value</em> **</p>
    <p>The archaeologist's method suggests an initially equal appraisal of the components that are found. Reading the work like a <em>kaleidoscope</em> <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-14" href="#note-14">14</a>]</small> emphasises that equality, as does the <em>juxtaposition</em> of all the visual motifs. The biographical aspects of the particular artist are brought into the interpretation not immediately and exclusively, but only at a second stage. This exercise helps to reveal motifs in the work that are different from the usual iconic, and anthropomorphic ones that are commonly reduced to biography and takes them into account in the interpretation of the work.</p>
    <p>Myriam Mihindou is before all else a sculptress. She often makes use of organic materials. Patience and allowing time to do its work play an important role here. She makes collages, ceramic objects, graphic work, photographs and videos. Performance is omnipresent, sometimes with a public and sometimes without, usually recorded in photographs or video and edited to arrive at an exhibitable result. Besides time, the other invisible but significant factor is sound. Her intercontinental fields of operation vary from urban and rural locations to the art context and Facebook.
Visual motifs come, go and return, sometimes years later: the hand, the foot (of the artist), elastic, cotton, feathers, kaolin, flowers, soil (hard and soft), glue, egg, rubber, clay, flowers, felt, horn, language, glass, money, paraffin, needles, tights, butterfly, (cuttings from) dictionaries, silk thread, soap, cotton, cutlery, clothing, third persons with attributes.</p>
    <p>To discover relations between the large number and diversity of works of the past fifteen years, the archaeological metaphor that yields a mapping has been adopted. For this purpose the motifs used have been arranged <em>non-hierarchically</em> by type. This ordering opens up the reception to certain motifs and related works that in the course of time have become iconic because they have often been exhibited or made public in some other way, such as the series of photographs <em>Sculptures de chair</em> (Flesh sculptures, 1999-2000), <em>Relique d'un corps domestique</em> (Relic of a domestic body, 2000), <em>Division Plastique</em> (Plastic division, 2000), and the video <em>Folle</em> (Crazy woman, 2000). This brings other, underexposed &#x2013; including non-anthropomorphic &#x2013; motifs to the fore such as the butterfly, the soil, forks. In this way the viewer obtains a picture of their place in the oeuvre as a whole.
Furthermore, the order is <em>non-historical</em>: older works have the same status as more recent work. This choice is based on the fact that a motif can appear and then sometimes recur years later. Moreover, the mapping does not give <em>precedence</em> to any one medium or technique. These aspects disable Modernist quality criteria. <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-15" href="#note-15">15</a>]</small></p>
    <p>The artist herself, by the way, does apply a hierarchy. Mihindou's creative process is an ongoing reaction to the world around her, alternating with periods of introversion: 'I distinguish "works" (oeuvres), "research works" and "experimental works" (travaux). The latter two connect the "sublimated works" that are very rare: the "emotional trances" (transes-&#xE9;motion).' <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-16" href="#note-16">16</a>]</small></p>
    <p><strong>Four ensembles: restoration of the 'common skin'</strong> [^] In the interview with Rosi Braidotti (see note 1), Mihindou describes nomadism as a common skin. For her there is no other way of relating to so-called others. Seeing others as different is something that is learnt by education. To cling to difference is to suffer. If you belong to the common skin by nature, you come into conflict with what you encounter from elsewhere (people who judge others to be different). Paraphrase by the author.
 ]</p>
    <p>We thus find four <em>ensembles</em>: the hand, hand-manipulated nature, language and clothing, and the body of the other. Works assume a place in the ensemble that corresponds to the main motif. Each ensemble contains both main and subsidiary motifs. For instance, in the second ensemble the hand is sometimes present, sometimes not, while sculpted objects are the protagonist. The third ensemble, the most complex in terms of types of motifs, includes clothing and butterflies as well as language. A reading that proceeds from the first to the fourth ensemble reveals a direction: from (a part of) the artist's body (pars pro toto) via nature to the body of the other.  <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-17" href="#note-17">17</a>]</small></p>
    <p>What does this mapping yield? The ordering of visual motifs <em>irrespective</em> of the media, dates or places in which the works were made is used to trace the intercontinental rather than primarily the African potential of Mihindou's oeuvre. A <em>translation</em> is necessary from the <em>literal</em> (motifs) to the metaphorical (meaning). As Bal puts it: <em>'Abduction</em> is the way through which new ideas become possible. It makes creative leaps and has the singular as its starting point. It thrives on <em>uncertainty</em> and <em>speculation</em> but its origin in observable fact remains primary.' <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-10" href="#note-10">10</a>]</small></p>
    <p>The motifs act as conductors of the performative dialogues and bring two main artistic strategies to light. Ensembles I and II prove to show (traces of) actions connected with packaging and covering, or in a metaphorical sense, protecting and healing. These are combined to form languages connected with the hand.
Ensembles III and IV are concerned with exposing and revealing, or metaphorically casting off and liberating, releasing and discharging. These are combined to form languages connected with the body. Although differing in intensity, the same energy of healing permeates all the ensembles.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ensembles I and II &#x2013; Languages connected with the hand</strong>
    </p>
    <p>'The hand is for me a body, in the sense of anthropomorphism. I subject it to all that strangling once all the sensorial parts have been tied up, the points of contact cut off. I call that transformation of the cristation and fasciation of the hand "a power object". It is a mental pattern, a way of dealing with the boundaries between the physical and the mental so that the body is no longer a social object but a corporeal subject with its own power of representation'. <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-19" href="#note-19">19</a>]</small></p>
    <p>The video montage <em>Relique d'un corps domestique</em> (2011) functions as a hinge between the first two ensembles because of the composition and diversity of motifs that display (traces of) actions connected with packaging and covering. <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-20" href="#note-20">20</a>]</small> Mihindou's own characterisation, 'a collection of peripheral works of languages connected with the hand' makes it abundantly clear that the work breaks right through the artist's own hierarchy. It is like an archaeological excavation of her oeuvre down to the photographic series of the same name from 2000.  <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-21" href="#note-21">21</a>]</small></p>
    <p>In the space of a little more than a quarter of an hour, series of (often unpublished) images pass by like chapters. Images of the hand alternate with manipulations of the hand as a creative force. They are taken from the series <em>Sculptures de chair</em> (1999-2000), <em>Relique d'un corps domestique</em> (2000), and <em>Division plastique</em> (2000). That juxtaposition brings out the equivalence of hand and material, or as Mihindou puts it: 'That relation was confirmed when "I saw myself" photographing my hands&#x2026; I have always wondered why I saw my sculptures as living, organic material. I sculpt with instable, fluid, malleable materials like oil, water, soil, paraffin, modelling clay, soap&#x2026; All those acts of "opening" translate the extension of my body in a given space'. <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-22" href="#note-22">22</a>]</small></p>
    <p>The audio underlines the archaeological character of the work: you hear someone leafing through pages, looking for something. The footsteps on creaking lava (Ile de la R&#xE9;union) conjure up the opening of the earth in search of the past. The sounds are borrowed from earlier works, for instance the cowbells come from the 2004 video <em>La colonne vide</em> (The empty column). This recycling underlines the excavation of the past even more.</p>
    <p>The collection of photographs, sketches and stills of <em>Relique d'un corps domestique</em> is composed of seven chapters. For the translation from the literal to the metaphorical, the following description of the separate chapters links factual perception to interpretations that are close to that perception and are derived from conversations with the artist.</p>
    <p>I.
'Aire de Assises' (Area of sitting women) opens with two texts: 'The Luba sculptors made stools in the shape of caryatids. They usually represented a high-ranking woman, reduced to the status of a slave in the art of supporting. At the time these chiefs used slave women of flesh and blood as a seat.' <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-23" href="#note-23">23</a>]</small> The comparison is made with Greek and Roman <em>stolatae</em> (high-ranking women), rows of marble statues in the shape of women who support a building. The resemblance between the social histories of the two cultures is striking. The texts are followed by photographs of free and bound powdered hands on a surface of paraffin, cracked earth and animal skins.</p>
    <p>II.
The short 'Pied li&#xE9;' (Bound foot) shows alternating bound and free ('au repos') powdered hands &#x2013; sometimes with marbles &#x2013; and feet.</p>
    <p>III.
'Les hybrides, trois mains ligatur&#xE9;es' (The hybrids, three bound hands) is the longest chapter. It opens with a studio shot of three photographs of bound hands. Outstretched arms draw in prepared soil, an arm rests in plaster, a shot of powdered feet seen from above. They are followed by black-and-white photographs of a hand that binds another hand with elastic. New elements are introduced such as sketches, photographs of tree roots, and a dozen black-and-white photographs of a hand with a small mirror. The latter were taken from a boat on the Mekong in Vietnam. The mirror reflects the river. The Greek phrase <em>Hos thremma agrion</em> appears between two mirror images. <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-24" href="#note-24">24</a>]</small> The sequence and the repetition suggest a step forwards and back again.</p>
    <p>IV. and V.
Although played non-chronologically, 'Elevage des paroles 1998' (Word breeding) and 'Poup&#xE9;es espaces 1995' (Cosmic dolls) belong together thematically. The hand is not present in either of them, but the viewer sees the results of manipulation by hand. The former is an enigmatic title because there are no words and no breeding to be seen. What the viewer sees are suspended objects that shortly afterwards, according to a sketch, turn out to be moist stones ('pierres humides'). Mihindou elaborates on these souvenirs from her travels by packaging them and rubbing them with mud repeatedly and for long periods. The <em>Poup&#xE9;es espaces</em> are clay dolls. A word in copper wire, covered with a thin layer of clay, emerges from one of the eight: it is 'fluctuating' ('fluctuant'). The materials used &#x2013; soil, clay, copper &#x2013; in both chapters suggest earthing and conduction. The presence of the word 'words' in the title of the fourth and of a word written in copper wire in the fifth chapter indicates that language also plays a part in the fourth: a hidden language.</p>
    <p>VI.
The sixth chapter, 'Demeures li&#xE9;es 1996' (Bound residences), shows a series of photographs in which hands encased in rubber gloves try to hold egg yolks in place with adhesive tape. The photographs are followed by a poetic text. <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-25" href="#note-25">25</a>]</small> This is in turn followed by a still from Helm (edifying nightmare), <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-26" href="#note-26">26</a>]</small> a video in which the artist leans her head back and utters sounds. Then Mihindou has a pair of tights over her head, and the ensuing images show a hand in tights with alternating closed and open fingers.</p>
    <p>VII.
'Medecine child' (Medicine child) concludes the visual epic. A child's hand, filmed from above, holds a white fluffy teddybear upside down in the shape of a cross. Two women's hands enclose a child's hand. The bear is touched with small sticks with fluffy tips. He ends up back in the cruciform position, this time right way up. The images evoke an atmosphere of shielding by and from innocence. Then two forks appear, first in a sketchbook. This is followed by photographs of two linked forks that hold a ball of soil or clay. Like the title <em>Relique d'un corps domestique</em>, this element refers to the codified role of the woman. Cutlery is her toolbox. In combination with the images of mother and child, this concluding series points towards purification and acceptance.</p>
    <p>The whole of <em>Relique d'un corps domestique</em> is characterised by the artistic strategy of packaging and covering. It is an associative trail full of sidetracks, diversions, flashbacks, loose ends and interruptions. It can be read as a non-linear account of engaging with confrontations and searching for and finding protection and healing. The historical references to the caryatids and the <em>stolatae</em> are a prelude to what follows: a relic of the subjected woman.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ensembles III-IV Languages connected with the body</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The third and fourth ensembles consist of works that expose and reveal. The video <em>La robe envol&#xE9;e</em> (The flown away dress, 2008) represents this strategy with its composition in terms of image, atmosphere and language. It throws light on the relation between common motifs and themes, such as tights as a second skin, the butterfly, the position of women, language, and shedding one's skin or transition. The same type of factual description is presented here as for <em>Relique d'un corps domestique</em>, and linking it with information from external sources results in the final reading.</p>
    <p>This film, a performance-based video lasting almost twenty minutes, was made on the Spanish island of Gran Canaria. A live audience in a different space could watch the performance on a screen. The viewer is witness to a 'transe-&#xE9;motion' which exposes a woman's struggle (in the person of Mihindou) to appreciate herself and to be herself. You see the lower part of her body, seated on a chair. The performance consists of cutting open and pulling off her tights. The tights are then used to bind the legs, to constrict them, until the woman 'hangs up' her legs. She continues to tussle and tug at the tights until they hang in skin-like strips. The action resembles a shedding of the skin, like the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly, but it is a painful and forced transition.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the voice-over, <em>La robe envol&#xE9;e</em> is an important source of information about the motivations behind Mihindou's oeuvre. The voice of a Spanish woman talks about the skin as a veil, about the impossibility of feeling anything on the skin: 'I've always wanted to tear it off, this skin&#x2026;' <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-27" href="#note-27">27</a>]</small> She recounts that as a child she learnt from nature and has often emigrated. To change one's skin is to change one's way of thinking. In doing so she loses herself and has to be born again. She remembers the philosophical significance of masks and the dead, the abstraction of the body, but to remove the body is like removing the meaning of existence. She escapes into myths that filter reality so that she can look around her again. She has not spoken for a number of years because she had to regain a certain purity of her femininity. She says that she has had to recognise for herself that the body was nothing more than the container of a soul, but she still feels like a fossil in a body that has not yet found its place in the cocoon. She has always been told that she must not show her butterfly, but she can no longer hide it, she has no place any more. She exclaims: 'I'm very afraid of letting myself be discovered&#x2026; It&#x2019;s&#x2026; something&#x2026; I can&#x2019;t!...show my skin!...I can&#x2019;t!!!!... I shouldn&#x2019;t!!!!....the feeling is annoying&#x2026;perhaps&#x2026; The feeling is perhaps indecent&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t think so&#x2026;' <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-28" href="#note-28">28</a>]</small> Her final statement is: 'I&#x2019;ve never seen the butterfly&#x2026; But I&#x2019;ve always opened the chrysalis&#x2026; And my whole work has consisted in accompanying the opening of this&#x2026;chrysalis, this intimate chrysalis&#x2026; This political and social chrysalis.' <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-29" href="#note-29">29</a>]</small></p>
    <p>The search for a mythical dimension runs up against obstacles to really emerging from the chrysalis and letting the butterfly free. In spite of the acquired inability or prohibition on seeing herself (the butterfly) and showing herself, the woman has still found ways of working from that closed and blindfolded situation in order to link her intimate space with that of others and thereby with the political and social reality.</p>
    <p><em>La robe envol&#xE9;e</em> is a 'transe-&#xE9;motion', like <em>La colonne vide</em> and <em>Breathing</em>.[^] <em>La colonne vide</em>, video, 6&#x2019;20&#x201D;, Paris, Place des Invalides, 2004; <em>Breathing</em>, performance, Overvecht (Utrecht), 2011, on the occasion of the opening of the solo exhibition &#x2018;Traces of Transition&#x2019;, Galerie Sanaa, Utrecht (NL).
] After a very concentrated period of mental preparation, sometimes lasting months, the artist ventures into a certain area in the mind in order to enter into a trance. In this case Mihindou explored the limits of memory there and allowed the viewer to share in the search that takes her back to her childhood. The automatic flow of words, interrupted by short or longer pauses, seems to effect a cathartic release after the unidentified trauma after which she did not speak for years. After the performance of this 'transe-&#xE9;motion',Mihindou opted for a translation into Spanish (the language of the location where the performance took place) of the original French version to create a distance from the intimacy that had come out into the open. This shows that the artist did not know beforehand what was going to happen. She lets whatever will come come, in this case a shedding of the skin and with it a release and liberation.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Traces of transitions</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The inclusive method of reading the work of Mihindou, the non-hierarchical nature of the approaches of Bal and Woets, shows that the performative dialogues are inserted in the social collective as a metaphor for the healing of the common skin, reactions to confrontations arising from alterity as experienced by others.[^] Paraphrase from interview by Rosi Braidotti, 4 September 2011, Galerie Sanaa, Utrecht.
] In the light of Ramadan's conflict of perceptions, <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-30" href="#note-30">30</a>]</small> a new window is opened that offers a shift in the view of this oeuvre.</p>
    <p>The films, objects and photographs are traces of transitions. The artist herself speaks of 'r&#xE9;manence',{^] Live interview by the author with Mihindou, July 2011.] of what remains. She evokes the image of a shower that leaves puddles of water behind. The evaporation of those puddles is the artistic and therapeutic process that she goes through as an artist. The specific gravity changes from water to vapour, from weight to lightness.</p>
    <p>Although only two works of Mihindou have been discussed here, the lines that have been cast may help to interpret the oeuvre as a whole as a transformation process of (collective) memories that may take place via (a part of) the body of the artist, via nature (ensembles I, II and III), or the bodies of others (ensemble IV).
The mnemotechnic <small class="note">[<a class="note-backref" id="note-backref-31" href="#note-31">31</a>]</small> search for liberation from memories of violence, madness, death and emptiness is made possible with the assistance of poetry, myths and dreams, where a certain degree of detachment can be attained. Because the mental (invisible) is made visible, this may sometimes disorientate the viewer. Boundaries between life and death, dream and reality, man and woman, body and nature become fluid.</p>
    <p>Mihindou's artistic work bears witness to an inner desire to restore the common skin, with or on behalf of herself, nature or the human world, to encounter through confrontation. The oeuvre is an ode to nature but also to the creativity of human beings who are able to create a meta-reality in order to bear everyday reality.</p>

Postcolonial authors have emphasized and even &#x201C;fetishized&#x201D; differences and particularisms while they have, at the same time, claimed a new globalism or universalism which levels out differences as well as the fractures of old colonial hegemonies.&#x2019; Tobias Wendl, &#x2018;Amselle, Jean-Loup, L&#x2019;art de la friche.

      <li>Original citation: &#x2018;La main pour moi est un corps, je parle d&#x2019;antropomorphisme. Je lui fais subir toutes ces strangulations car toutes les parties sensorielles sont garrott&#xE9;es, les points de contact sectionn&#xE9;s. J&#x2019;appelle cette transformation de la cristation et de la fasciation de la main &#x201C;a power object&#x201D;. C&#x2019;est un sch&#xE9;ma mental, une gestion des limites entre le physique et le mental pour que le corps ne soit plus le corps social objet mais un corps sujet qui aurait son propre pouvoir de repr&#xE9;sententation.&#x2019; Written interview by the author with Mihindou, August 2005. <a class="note" id="note-19" href="#note-backref-19">&#x21A9;</a></li>

      <li>Because <em>Relique d&#x2019;un corps domestique</em> reprises so many old works, it is here discussed before <em>La robe envol&#xE9;e</em>, although it was completed later. Although the adjective 'archaeological' suggests a comparison with the method of reading the oeuvre described above, it here refers exclusively to the nature of the work of art <em>Relique d&#x2019;un corps domestique</em>. <a class="note" id="note-21" href="#note-backref-21">&#x21A9;</a></li>
